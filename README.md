## Intro
An unorganized Windows 11 latency optimization resource list.

I set out to experiment and try different tweaks posted on the internet, along with following other online users on Reddit, blurbusters forums, etc.

I have incorporated the easiest and most impactful tweaks to apply to every desktop system here.

For laptop systems, these tweaks are not recommended on battery, as they are designed to push the system to maximum performance, however they are expected to drain battery faster.

## Max performance with some energy savings

Two great programs, [limit-nvpstate](https://github.com/valleyofdoom/limit-nvpstate), and (ProcessLasso)[https://bitsum.com/], can help preserve battery, power, and reduce system heat while still retaining 100% of the performance.

++ limit-nvpstate works alongside the GlobalTimerResolution setting to only run the GPU at full speed when specific games/apps are added to a list. That way, your GPU isn't running full speed at all times.

++ ProcessLasso has the IdleSaver feature to kick out of Bitsum Highest Performance when the system has been idle <x> amount of seconds.

## Pushing Windows without fear of instability

These tweaks do not interfere with system stability and are recommended to run on any Windows 11 system. It is not recommended on Windows 10 due to changes in features such as timer resolution and FSO.

## Issues, Pull Requests, and Feedback

Please feel free to provide feedback or any additional tweaks you would like me to research. I appreciate all the stars on this project!
